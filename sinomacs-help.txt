There are thousands of Emacs commands that have complex and difficult to remember keystrokes.  An easier way to invoke these is to type Alt-X and then the name of the command.  For example:

Alt-X re-builder    Start creating a regular expression (pcre syntax)	 
Alt-X occur	    Show all lines matching a pattern

Function keys F8 to F12 are reserved for commands that pertain to particular types of files.
