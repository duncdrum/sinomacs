* About Sinomacs

  =Sinomacs= is an attempt to make it easier for Sinologists to use
  the =Kanseki Repository= and =Mandoku=. While =Mandoku= is an Emacs
  package that provides access to the =Kanseki Repository=, =Sinomacs=
  is a customization for Emacs. The difference is the following: While
  =Mandoku= is carefully designed to blend in to an existing Emacs
  configuration and behaves like any other Emacs package in that
  respect, =Sinomacs= tries to change many aspects of Emacs to make it
  easier for users without previous experience of Emacs and without a
  technical background to use =Mandoku= productively.  


* Orgmode

  One of the major components of Emacs (and Mandoku and Sinomacs) is
  =Orgmode=  cite:Dominik201408 . This is an extension to Emacs that allows note-taking,
  planning, writing of academic articles and documenting of
  reproducible research.
